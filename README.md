The "Heart Disease Prediction Using Various Machine Learning Classification Methods" project explores the application of machine learning and deep learning models to predict heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease dataset, enhanced with synthetic data generated via SMOTE to address class imbalance. Baseline models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM were compared with advanced models like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Graph Attention Network (GAT), and GraphSAGE. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 93.5%, closely followed by MLP at 91.8%, demonstrating their suitability for clinical applications due to their consistent and reliable predictions. Graph-based methods like GraphSAGE provided valuable insights into feature relationships, albeit with slightly lower accuracy. The study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy, enable early intervention, and enhance healthcare outcomes.
